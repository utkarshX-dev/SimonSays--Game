# Simon Says Game

Welcome to the **Simon Says** game! This is a classic memory game where players are required to repeat a sequence of colors (or sounds) generated by the computer. The sequence becomes progressively longer, and the goal is to remember and replicate the sequence correctly.

This game was created using **JavaScript** for the logic, **HTML** for the structure, and **CSS** for styling.

## How to Play

1. Tap a key to start the game.
2. The computer will show a random sequence of colored buttons, and you need to repeat the same sequence by clicking the corresponding buttons.
3. If you correctly repeat the sequence, the game will add a new color to the sequence.
4. If you make a mistake, the game will end and show you your score.

The game continues until you fail to replicate the sequence.
